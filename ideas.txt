during parsing/evaluation create big buffer and alloc from there,
    after done free/zero the big chunk of memeory

hashmap for keyords in lexer

while loop for parse_expression instead of self-recursive calls,
    same thing with eval_expression

"Store the furthest error: In a backtracking parser, you can encounter multiple syntax errors; report the one furthest in the input. 
A known strategy is to record any error only if it occurs at a later token position than previous errors​. 
At the end, report the error that consumed the most tokens (i.e. the “farthest” reach) as it’s usually the most relevant​."

Each object could have it's own eval function that is called instead of eval_expression, don't think this works for parse_expression though



Can do something like this with const, but it feels weird
    case FUNCTION_NODE:
        eval_function(static_cast<const function*>(nodes[i]), env);
        ...
    
    static void eval_function (const function* func, environment* env) {
        ...
    }
