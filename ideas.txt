    after done free/zero the big chunk of memeory

hashmap for keyords in lexer

"Store the furthest error: In a backtracking parser, you can encounter multiple syntax errors; report the one furthest in the input. 
A known strategy is to record any error only if it occurs at a later token position than previous errors​. 
At the end, report the error that consumed the most tokens (i.e. the “farthest” reach) as it’s usually the most relevant​."
